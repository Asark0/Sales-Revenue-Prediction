# Sales-Revenue-Prediction

Employ the scikit-learn module for calculating the linear regression, while using pandas for data management, and seaborn for plotting. I used Advertising data set to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper.

I am capable to do the following:

    Explain the core ideas of linear regression to technical and non-technical audience

    Build a simple linear regression model in Python with scikit-learn

    Employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to small data sets with seaborn and pandas
